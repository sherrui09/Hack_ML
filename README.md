# ESG Scorer Project
Robinhood 2022 Hackathon Winner


Using ESG Scorer:
The ESG Scorer consists of two functionalities:
1. Calculate a DOW 30 company's ESG score and visualize their strengths and weaknesses by applying a natural language processing model on 500 related news articles:
- Choose a DOW 30 company to ESG-examine.
- Optionally, choose another DOW 30 company to compare and contrast with the first.
- Click the "Get ESG Data" button. The scores and a radar chart should be available for view within a few seconds!

2. Calculate the ESG score of a text snippet and visualize the frequency of ESG-related keywords based on sentiment analysis:
- Enter a text snippet (preferably ESG-related) into the text box.
- Click the "Analyze ESG" button. The scores and a word cloud should be available for view within a few seconds!
